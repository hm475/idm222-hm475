            <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
            I have experience in both HTML and CSS, as well as hosting platforms such as GitHub Pages and Blue Host.
            I also have fair experience using website drafting tools such as figma. 
            <div class="break"><br></div>
            Along with these, I also have experience using Microsoft Office, Google Suite, and the iWork category of applications. 
            <div class="break"><br></div>
            On top of those, I have experience with digital art tools such as Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and Maya.

              <h2>Social Skills</h2>
              As you will see in my <a href="Experience.html">experiences</a>, I have a great deal of social aptitude both inside and 
              outside of the workplace. I pride myself on being empathetic and quickly understanding other people's situations in life 
              from only a short story.
              <div class="break"><br></div>
              This also always helps me be quick on the uptake in other situations outside of social ones, but sometimes the greatest 
              thing you can do for someone is be there for them!

            <h2>Practical Skills</h2>
            While I am a practitioner of many things, practical skills are my favorite! As said before, I am a quick thinker.
            I wholeheartedly believe that there isn't anything I can't figure out if given a few days to look into it. I pride 
            myself on my perceptive abilities and being able to notice the smallest details even at a glance.
            <div class="break"><br></div>
            While I don't like to boast, however, I am also good at reading, writing and arithmetic! I got top marks on my SATs 
            and ACTs and was in the top 5 scorers of my highschool!
