    Between 2015 and 2019, I attended String Theory High School. A charter school in the City that was renowned for its arts programs on all fronts. They had vocal, instrumental, dance, classical and digital art, linguistics, and I even petitioned to get culinary arts added one&nbsp;year!
  <br><br>
    Besides the arts, they also had strong math and English classes. I took everything from Algebra 1 to Calculus 2 and we even had a Harvard graduate teaching our Analytics&nbsp;class!
  <br><br>
    Ontop of this, we were offered French as an elective which I took all 4 years and passed with flying&nbsp;colors!

  In the Autumn of 2019, I started at Drexel as an undeclared art major. Out of everybody in my high school, only us lucky few out of my class were able to make it into&nbsp;Drexel.
<br><br>
  It took two terms, but halfway through the Winter quarter of 2020, I decided that I wanted to major in <a href="https://drexel.edu/westphal/academics/undergraduate/EAM/" target="_blank"> Entertainment Arts Management</a> (or just EAM for short). Being the person to put the "biz" in "showbiz" sounded interesting to me and I signed up! Along with my major, it comes with a built in minor in&nbsp;business.
<br><br>
  One global pandemic later and I am almost ready to graduate in the Spring term of 2023. I learned a lot more than I thought I would in a business class and my courses took me to all kinds of feilds like animation, film production, website design, and&nbsp;more!
