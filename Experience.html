      <h2>Social Media</h2>
      During the Summer of 2022, I worked as a Social Media Manager for an arts nonprofit called <a href="https://artsphere.org/" target="_blank">ArtSphereInc</a>.
      It was here that I received training both on and off site by helping with day-to-day activities and also taking virtual training seminars.
      <div class="break"><br></div>
      As I said in the job title, I was the social media manager. It was my duty to gather stories from our employees and partners to write and upload to the company's social platforms.
      Thanks to the training seminars, I was able to boost the company's reach and message through the power of S.E.O. (Search Engine Optimization!)

      <h2>Sporting Events</h2>
      The Summer before last (2021), I worked with a sporting producer called "Celebrity Boxing LLC." I served as the Assistant to the General Counsel and it was
      my duty to make sure the stages were set, everyone was where they needed to be, and that we were clear filming.
      <div class="break"><br></div>
      During this job, I even got to meet the late Aaron Carter as he was the headline fight against Lamar Odom. Sadly, he did not win the fight that night, but it was
      really a great match to watch from my staff position.

      <h2>...And Beyond!</h2>
      I don't believe I will ever be finished gaining new experiences. I am always learning and journeying around this wild world we live in.
      Every single day that I have been alive I find something new, big and small.
      <div class="break"><br></div>
      I also hope that I never do find everything I'm ever looking for. I am a fond believer in the quest for knowledge, but it's a quest that I hope never ends!
