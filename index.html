      <p>
        I have experience in photo/video editing, social media management, personnel coordination, cultural learning, supervisorary positions, and now I am proud to add website managment to this list as&nbsp;well!

        To be more specific on my past experiences, I have directly been in charge of company social media accounts where I gathered, wrote, edited, and published stories for the company single-handedly. These topics ranged from interviews to on site documentation of sponsored events. Because of this, I have personally dealt with national news stations and international corporate executives.
        I have also helped manage a live PPV sporting event and handled such matters as stage setting, talent coordination, check ins and check outs, saftey protocols, and travel&nbsp;arrangements.
